= EngineRoom

EngineRoom aims to be a simple to use, unobtrusive admin interface for rails applications. It is designed to be an add-on for existing web apps and not a full blown CMS. Just add EngineRoom to an app and it will create a customizable interface for editing the content data.

Development is still in its early stages, not ready for production use yet.

= Features

* configure which models and which fields are editable
* customize form fields 
* support for has_many and belongs_to relationships
* authentication und user management using Devise[http://github.com/plataformatec/devise]
* currently supports admin and non-admin roles, where the admin can configure the interface and create new users
* support for image uploads
* localization support (currently English and German)

  gem 'engine_room'

  bundle install
